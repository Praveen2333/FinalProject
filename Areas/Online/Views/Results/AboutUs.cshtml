            <h1>Smart Question Bank</h1>
            <p>
                Creating exams without question bank it is very painful. If you have a good question bank then examiner can easily create an exam. Every examiner has its own question bank that he uses for creating exams. As the examiner maintaining question bank is very difficult. Also, it is very painful when we create an exam from the question bank when your question bank is huge because selecting a unique question from a huge question bank it is quite tedious.

            <h1>Study Material For Exams</h1>
            <p>
                Study Material is one of the best feature available in Online Exams.

                For every exam we have some specific syllabus, after conducting an exam it is very difficult to share its syllabus. When we do it manually it is not possible to share this syllabus document with everyone. Also, in some cases this study material is confidential and the examiner doesn’t want to share with everyone for free of cost.

                To solve this problem Online Exams provides a great feature for the examiner. In Online Exams Examiner can share study material with students before the exams.
